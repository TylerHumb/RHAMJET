        <p>My name is Jamie and I come from the west side of Melbourne, Australia and I have experience in three years' worth of Python, as well as experience in Visual Basic and using Arduinos. Currently I am interested in learning more about the fields of cybersecurity and both the vulnerabilities of systems in use every day and how to protect against those sorts of attacks. In my spare time, I like to read and study history and consider myself knowledgeable in the areas of the French Revolution as well as watch media analysis videos on YouTube on movies and other forms of media in addition to learning film techniques. I form the 'Jâ€™ initial of team RHAMJET.</p>
