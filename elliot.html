I graduated high school in 2020. I have a 2-year-old cat and a fishpond. In my free time, my hobbies include playing video games, drawing, and hanging out with my cat. My interest in IT mainly revolves around the more graphical aspects, such as 3D modeling. I have no experience in this field however but would like to start learning someday. I do not have any IT experience to date, however I am currently learning how to code in Python, HTML and CSS, as per the program I’m currently studying. Someday in the future, I would love to become a video game developer. I form the 'E’ initial of team RHAMJET. </p>

        <p>Whenever I have time to kill, I like to fill up my time just playing videogames. Quite recently I've decided that spending valuable hours of my human life on unproductive things is not very wise to say the least, so I've taken to other methods of spending my free time. Instead I love to doodle random things in a notebook before bed, and I've taken up 2D animation. I'm still very much at the beginner level, so I can't say I've produced anything worthy of flattery yet. I'm also very interested in game design, I love binge watching video essays on the design principles behind various games and looking at concept art. I'll also study a game to death so that I can play it as efficiently as possible, as well as sucking the fun out of it. That's about the extent of game dev skills that I possess.
