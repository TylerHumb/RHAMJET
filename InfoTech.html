          <h3 id="CloudComputing">Cloud Computing</h3>
          <div class='CC1'>
            <p>Cloud Computing is defined as “the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet” (Microsoft, section Benefits), with a multitude of services in a post-Covid world available for any users, both business and individual to use. The most recognized application of Cloud Computing to the average person in 2022 would be for data storage, such as OneDrive and iCloud, which has the functionality to store files ranging from images to databases on a remote server. Other applications of cloud technology are: </p>
            <div class='CClist1'>
              <ul>
                <li>Streaming Services, which offers users new ways of consuming media content on demand. Examples of services taking advantage of cloud computing include Twitch, which allows users to livestream and interact with people watching in real time, Netflix, which allows users to watch any media content from their library on demand and on multiple devices, and Spotify, which allows users to listen to music on demand as well from anywhere without needing to download it.</li>
                <li>Communication Services connect users from any location with an internet connection. Examples of this service are Zoom and FaceTime, which use cloud-computing to send input data such as sound and camera footage to a server and distribute it on the other end of the call. </li>
                <li>Digital Distribution is increasingly using cloud-technology to distribute digital content, whether it be services like Steam providing a store interface to purchase and download games without owning a physical copy or install updates for live services. Also, they can facilitate live-service gaming, such as Massive Multiplayer Online games or Free to Play games (examples being World of Warcraft, Fortnite or Genshin Impact) by allowing users to play together. </li>
                <li>Cloud VPN, a specific type of VPN that, according to Techopedia, “utilises a cloud-based network infrastructure to deliver VPN services” (Section “What does Cloud VPN mean”) and thus is more flexible as it doesn’t rely on the user having a VPN infrastructure on their end.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>These applications all share the primary benefits of flexibility and affordability, as cloud computing puts the work in remote servers that belong to the service rather than requiring the users to have specific requirements.</p>
            <p>However, while the concept of cloud computing had existed ever since the days of ARPANET, it would only become widespread for businesses once Amazon had launched Amazon Web Services in 2006, which offered third parties a “variety of cloud-based services including storage, computation and ‘human intelligence’.” (Keith D. Foote December 17, 2021, Section The Early 2000s) as well as renting data centers and virtual machines which would lead to the idea of Software as a Service (SaaS) to sell cloud computing. After 2010, other companies would begin to offer their own cloud services to use, such as OpenStack, ICloud and the IBM SmartCloud but it would be OracleCloud that would offer the three recognisable models of a cloud service, like Software as a Service but additionally Infrastructure as a Service (offer the building blocks of cloud computing and allow developers to build their own), Platform As a Service (offers a baseline infrastructure so developers can build and bundle their software) and Data as a Service (offers an aggregation of data from users for developers to utilise for their own needs).  Thanks to the Covid-19 Global Pandemic forcing everyone into quarantine, cloud computing became almost ubiquitous overnight, as cloud services became widely in demand such as Zoom due to their flexibility to allow users to study and work from home and greatly accelerated development into cloud computing. </p>
            <p>As such, the predicted forecast of what cloud computing can do in the next three years are: </p>
            <div class='CClist2'>
              <ul>
                <li>Further refinement of a 5th type of Service Model, the Workstation as a Service (WaaS), allowing users to remotely access applications and information from whatever device is available on which coincides in the rising demand for work-from-home benefits in jobs.</li>
                <li>Open-Source Cloud Computing which would allow businesses to not be locked into one cloud service provider and be only capable of using that vendor exclusively as well as save costs by not having to pay high fees.</li>
                <li>More emphasis on eCommerce as a model for many businesses going forward as using cloud computing for a store front brought convenience on the users end and allowed purchases to be made without ever needing to go outside. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='CC2'>
            <h4>Likely Impact</h4>
            <p>In the ever-expanding field of information technology, new advancements are constantly being made. One such is the shift of allowing open-source cloud computing to be made available to businesses. Data is a valuable resource where corporations must effectively use and transform it into usable data. This “’Proliferation of data,’ means businesses increasingly need common digital data standards” (Duncan.M, 2022, Cloud Tech) if they are to gather more consumers and expand their business practices. To achieve this, several companies have banded together to create a “Data Cloud Alliance”. What this aims to accomplish is improving how data is currently used, as well as increasing access to it. This is done through allowing data to be compatible with multiple platforms and just overall improving the handling of data, “data governance, data privacy, data loss prevention, and global compliance” (Duncan.M, 2022). This would benefit businesses, improving their transformation of data. Consumers would mainly benefit from having improved user experiences, such as increasing the accessibility of e-commerce models to users. </p>
            <p>There is another development soon to come, Workstation as a Service (WaaS), which is a new type of service model. This model is gradually being adopted across workplaces and education settings and has the potential to fundamentally change how we approach working. With Covid-19 forcing everyone to live in isolation, the work from home approach has become a wildly adopted method. The way WaaS works is through having a workspace provider, such as Microsoft, hosting software on their own servers where the user can access these workspaces on their own devices. WaaS has immense potential in affecting the standards of how we work and where it brings benefits, such as allowing workers and users to “Work from anywhere,” “Get secure digital workspaces,” “reduce office costs,” “Customize your workspace solutions,” “work uninterrupted” (Ace cloud hosting editor, 2020). Workstation as a Service would likely bring a lot of flexibility into the workflow of a user, allowing the same benefits experienced in Work-From-Home set ups such as more free time, better mental wellbeing as well as cutting down on commute times. </p>
          </div>
          <div class='CC3'>
            <h4>How will this affect you:</h4>
            <p>The advancements in cloud technology are already noticeable to the average user and has come to be seen as a necessity. The WaaS model is already being utilised by students through applications such as Microsoft Teams. This comes with a wide range of benefits, one which allows students the freedom of working from wherever, whenever with an internet connection. With the current state of the pandemic, working from home is almost a necessity, as well as being very convenient. Many workplaces are starting to adopt working from home as a viable method of running things, as people are beginning to realize the convenience of it. Organizations can set up digital workspaces within a provider and customize it to suit the user’s needs. WaaS offers users' access to applications they couldn’t run, preventing the need for them to purchase and download superfluous apps of which may never be used, everything will be provided to us by the workstation host. This is immensely helpful to a lot of people, as many of us come from different financial backgrounds, where the pandemic would have disrupted the livelihoods of many, so this is a welcome feature. Many applications also go by a subscription-based model, so it’s nice to avoid it whenever possible. As everything is hosted on the service provider’s servers, there comes a risk of the servers being down for maintenance, becoming compromised from malicious attacks or other external factors. </p>
            <p>With the advent of open-source cloud computing, businesses may see a great surge in development of business infrastructure and customer data analytics. As customers, we would most likely receive more personalized user experiences with using the services of these businesses, online shopping as an example. Many people are preferring an online shopping experience as opposed to doing physical shopping, as during the pandemic, online commerce “grew 44% and represented more than 21% of total retail sales” (Maryville University, first paragraph), so corporations have started to shape and manipulate our shopping experiences, with help from open-source cloud computing. What we should expect from this development is a very personalized, and maybe unsettling shopping experience where the system will try to market relevant products to you. </p>

          <h3 id=autovehicle>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
            <div class='AV1'>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>With the development and advancement of automation, automated driving is becoming more and more popular. Self-driving vehicles reduce the labor cost of driving, however, can have an impact on employment because of replacing the driver's presence or reducing the requirements for drivers. An autonomous vehicle, as known as a self-driving car, which is a vehicle that can sense its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. (Wikipedia, 2022) “An autonomous vehicle uses variety kinds of sensors to recognize the environment around it, such as camera, GPS, sonar, lidar, thermographic camera and inertial measurement units.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class='AV2'>
              <h4>History and Current Use</h4>
                <p>The first autonomous vehicle model was created at the 1939 World’s Fair by General Motors and turned into reality in 1958. it was an electric vehicle guided by radio-controlled electromagnetic fields and operated from magnetized metal spikes embedded in the roadway and can control the steering wheel to left or right depending on the current flowing detected using sensor through a wire embedded in the road. (tomorrowsworldtoday, n.d.) </p>
                <p>According to the definition of 6 levels of driving automation by The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), self-driving vehicles are ranged from level 0 (entirely manually) to level 5 (entirely autonomous). (synopsys, 2022)</p>
                <div>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Level 0 – No driving automation, fully controlled by human driver. </li>
                    <li>Level 1 – Driver assistance, either steering or acceleration/deceleration is controlled by human driver. </li>
                    <li>Level 2 – Partial Automation, both steering and acceleration/deceleration is controlled by one or more driver assistance systems. </li>
                    <li>Level 3 – Conditional Automation, specific driving mode performance of autonomous driving systems in all aspects of dynamic driving tasks but expect human driver to respond appropriately to a request to intervene. </li>
                    <li>Level 4 – Highly Automation, specific driving mode performance of autonomous driving systems in all aspects of dynamic driving tasks, can pull over safely by guiding system even without human driver to respond appropriately to a request to intervene. </li>
                    <li>Level 5 – Full Automation, specific driving mode performance of autonomous driving systems in all aspects of dynamic driving tasks, able to act safely with guiding system under all conditions without human driver to respond and can be managed by human driver. </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For level 0 to level 2, vehicles are being driven with human drivers monitoring the environment, where level 3 to level 5, vehicles are driving with the environment monitored by the automated driving system. </p>
            </div>
            <div class='AV3'>
              <h4>Future of Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
              <p>Companies are working on level 3 conditional automation, which allows drivers have their eyes off the road but not mind off, which means they need to be ready to take back control from self-driving systems when alerted. However, self-driving systems are only able to reach level 2 partial automation in the 6 levels defined by SAE, where human drivers must monitor the driving environment on the road and respond to all situations (cars, 2022). “It’s our objective to roll out this technology this year,” says Kallenius, the CEO of Mercedes-Benz on the Mercedes’ 2021 results call. (Sigal, 2022) As the leader in the study of automated vehicles, Mercedes-Benz is working towards level 3 conditional automated vehicles and aiming to have them in production and put in use in 2022. </p>
              <p>There are number of challenges and difficulties in the development path of automated driving vehicles, the biggest challenge being the ethical aspect. Machines do not have the ability to consider moral issues like humans do, so it is very important for them to be able to make the most reasonable judgment and behaviour in times of crisis. “Driving requires many complex social interactions – which are still tough for robots” (Plumer, 2012). Self-driving on road involves interactions not only the driver and passengers in the self-driving vehicles, also other drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, therefore making the self-driving vehicles able to understand complex driving environment and make the most ethical or appropriate judgments are the main challenges. </p>
            </div>
            <div class='AV4'>
              <h4>Social and Economic Impacts of Autonomous Vehicles </h4>
              <p>There are several ways that self-driving will have impacts on society. They will dramatically improve the convenience and reduce the cost of traveling for people. Some people predict that as the road system is overhauled and become more efficient, the travel time will decrease immediately, bring a smoother traffic flow with less congestion at intersections and mergers. But on the other side, some people predict that as the increase of different cars being allowed on the road, the increase of congestions will appear (Yeruva, 2022). Self-driving cars can also increase the accessibility of mobility for people who are not able to drive such as, seniors, people with disabilities or even children, allow them to have better access to independent commuting. Use of self-driving cars is likely to decrease the effect of carbon emissions from vehicles on our environment. Self-driving cars will be harder to operate with fossil fuels, therefore they incentivise the switch to electric power as a power source (Darlington, 2018). “Along with that, self-driving cars might also cause economic impacts on the fossil fuel market.” </p>
              <h4>Impacts on Job Markets </h4>
              <p>Self-driving cars also have a great impact on the job market, leading a significant job loss. Report by The Center for Global Policy Solution published in 2017 shows that 4 million jobs can be lost due to the rapid transition to self-driving cars (Solutions, 2012). But on the other hand, jobs within the autonomous vehicle industry, such as, remote human operators, tele-operators or remote assistance, which will handle a situation when the self-driving car could not figure out how to respond (Coppola, 2021), will create more job positions, because the current technology only reach a level 2 automation which is not enough to make self-driving car to replace all the car with human driver on the road. </p>
              <h4>How will it affect you? </h4>
              <p>The exist of self-driving cars affect everyone, people who can drive, and people who are not able to drive like children, people with disabilities or elders. Once self-driving technology become stable enough to allow vehicles travel safely without human monitoring, people who cannot drive are become able to travel around with vehicles without the need of a driver. This also save time and energy for those who need to drive just pick up or drop off their family members or friends who cannot drive. Instead of needing a family member or friend to drive you or catching public transport and spend time on waiting the next bus or train, traveling with a self-driving car will be much convenient and more comfortable. </p>
              <p>According to a family member who specialises for a public transport maintenance company, said that the advent of self-driving cars might reduce the number of accident cause by human on the road, and the maintenance workload could be deceased as a result. The decrease in maintenance workload means that the company may no longer need that many employees, and he feels that he may end up losing his job. However, he still thinks that self-driving cars will brings positive effects on his family. He then no longer needs to pick up or drop off his children from or to their weekend activities and able to enjoy his break. The other member from my family who need to spend nearly two hours on driving between home and workplace said that if she owns a self-driving car, she could save plenty of time on driving, and while the vehicle driving her to workplace, she could rest longer or getting prepare for work, and she does not need to spend more energy on driving after a whole day working. </p>
