              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>With the development and advancement of automation, automated driving is becoming more and more popular. Self-driving vehicles reduce the labor cost of driving, however, can have an impact on employment because of replacing the driver's presence or reducing the requirements for drivers. An autonomous vehicle, as known as a self-driving car, which is a vehicle that can sense its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. (Wikipedia, 2022) “An autonomous vehicle uses variety kinds of sensors to recognize the environment around it, such as camera, GPS, sonar, lidar, thermographic camera and inertial measurement units.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class='AV2'>
              <h4>History and Current Use</h4>
                <p>The first autonomous vehicle model was created at the 1939 World’s Fair by General Motors and turned into reality in 1958. it was an electric vehicle guided by radio-controlled electromagnetic fields and operated from magnetized metal spikes embedded in the roadway and can control the steering wheel to left or right depending on the current flowing detected using sensor through a wire embedded in the road. (tomorrowsworldtoday, n.d.) </p>
                <p>According to the definition of 6 levels of driving automation by The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), self-driving vehicles are ranged from level 0 (entirely manually) to level 5 (entirely autonomous). (synopsys, 2022)</p>
                <div>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Level 0 – No driving automation, fully controlled by human driver. </li>
                    <li>Level 1 – Driver assistance, either steering or acceleration/deceleration is controlled by human driver. </li>
                    <li>Level 2 – Partial Automation, both steering and acceleration/deceleration is controlled by one or more driver assistance systems. </li>
                    <li>Level 3 – Conditional Automation, specific driving mode performance of autonomous driving systems in all aspects of dynamic driving tasks but expect human driver to respond appropriately to a request to intervene. </li>
                    <li>Level 4 – Highly Automation, specific driving mode performance of autonomous driving systems in all aspects of dynamic driving tasks, can pull over safely by guiding system even without human driver to respond appropriately to a request to intervene. </li>
                    <li>Level 5 – Full Automation, specific driving mode performance of autonomous driving systems in all aspects of dynamic driving tasks, able to act safely with guiding system under all conditions without human driver to respond and can be managed by human driver. </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For level 0 to level 2, vehicles are being driven with human drivers monitoring the environment, where level 3 to level 5, vehicles are driving with the environment monitored by the automated driving system. </p>
            </div>
            <div class='AV3'>
              <h4>Future of Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
              <p>Companies are working on level 3 conditional automation, which allows drivers have their eyes off the road but not mind off, which means they need to be ready to take back control from self-driving systems when alerted. However, self-driving systems are only able to reach level 2 partial automation in the 6 levels defined by SAE, where human drivers must monitor the driving environment on the road and respond to all situations (cars, 2022). “It’s our objective to roll out this technology this year,” says Kallenius, the CEO of Mercedes-Benz on the Mercedes’ 2021 results call. (Sigal, 2022) As the leader in the study of automated vehicles, Mercedes-Benz is working towards level 3 conditional automated vehicles and aiming to have them in production and put in use in 2022. </p>
              <p>There are number of challenges and difficulties in the development path of automated driving vehicles, the biggest challenge being the ethical aspect. Machines do not have the ability to consider moral issues like humans do, so it is very important for them to be able to make the most reasonable judgment and behaviour in times of crisis. “Driving requires many complex social interactions – which are still tough for robots” (Plumer, 2012). Self-driving on road involves interactions not only the driver and passengers in the self-driving vehicles, also other drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, therefore making the self-driving vehicles able to understand complex driving environment and make the most ethical or appropriate judgments are the main challenges. </p>

            <div class='AV4'>
              <h4>Social and Economic Impacts of Autonomous Vehicles </h4>
              <p>There are several ways that self-driving will have impacts on society. They will dramatically improve the convenience and reduce the cost of traveling for people. Some people predict that as the road system is overhauled and become more efficient, the travel time will decrease immediately, bring a smoother traffic flow with less congestion at intersections and mergers. But on the other side, some people predict that as the increase of different cars being allowed on the road, the increase of congestions will appear (Yeruva, 2022). Self-driving cars can also increase the accessibility of mobility for people who are not able to drive such as, seniors, people with disabilities or even children, allow them to have better access to independent commuting. Use of self-driving cars is likely to decrease the effect of carbon emissions from vehicles on our environment. Self-driving cars will be harder to operate with fossil fuels, therefore they incentivise the switch to electric power as a power source (Darlington, 2018). “Along with that, self-driving cars might also cause economic impacts on the fossil fuel market.” </p>
              <h4>Impacts on Job Markets </h4>
              <p>Self-driving cars also have a great impact on the job market, leading a significant job loss. Report by The Center for Global Policy Solution published in 2017 shows that 4 million jobs can be lost due to the rapid transition to self-driving cars (Solutions, 2012). But on the other hand, jobs within the autonomous vehicle industry, such as, remote human operators, tele-operators or remote assistance, which will handle a situation when the self-driving car could not figure out how to respond (Coppola, 2021), will create more job positions, because the current technology only reach a level 2 automation which is not enough to make self-driving car to replace all the car with human driver on the road. </p>
              <h4>How will it affect you? </h4>
              <p>The exist of self-driving cars affect everyone, people who can drive, and people who are not able to drive like children, people with disabilities or elders. Once self-driving technology become stable enough to allow vehicles travel safely without human monitoring, people who cannot drive are become able to travel around with vehicles without the need of a driver. This also save time and energy for those who need to drive just pick up or drop off their family members or friends who cannot drive. Instead of needing a family member or friend to drive you or catching public transport and spend time on waiting the next bus or train, traveling with a self-driving car will be much convenient and more comfortable. </p>
              <p>According to a family member who specialises for a public transport maintenance company, said that the advent of self-driving cars might reduce the number of accident cause by human on the road, and the maintenance workload could be deceased as a result. The decrease in maintenance workload means that the company may no longer need that many employees, and he feels that he may end up losing his job. However, he still thinks that self-driving cars will brings positive effects on his family. He then no longer needs to pick up or drop off his children from or to their weekend activities and able to enjoy his break. The other member from my family who need to spend nearly two hours on driving between home and workplace said that if she owns a self-driving car, she could save plenty of time on driving, and while the vehicle driving her to workplace, she could rest longer or getting prepare for work, and she does not need to spend more energy on driving after a whole day working. </p>
