       <p style= "color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 14px" > My name is Roma and I come from the north side of Melbourne. I am culturally Indian however I have been born and brought up in Melbourne. I graduated high school in 2021 and I am currently studying for my bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I have experience in Python, HTML, Visual Basic and a little bit of Scratch 2. I enjoy programming and having to solve problems in the real-world and I would love to learn as many programming languages as possible therefore I am interested in software development. I also have a little bit of interest in cybersecurity. In my free time, I like to watch cricket, play netball, and spend time with my friends. I form the ‘R’ initial of team RHAMJET. </p>

       <h3 style= "color:#FFD166;" > MORE ABOUT MY HOBBIES </h3>
       <p style= "color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 14px" > One of my hobbies is watching cricket. My favourite player is Steve Smith. He is a batter in the Australian cricket team. Another hobby I have is taking photos of the natural world and landscape around me. Some of these pictures are in the images on the right. My time with my family is not special or always a happy feeling therefore I find my happiness through the memories of my friends and also spending time with them. </p>
