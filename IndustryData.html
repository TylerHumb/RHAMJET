          It is consensus among RHAMJET members that MBTI is a largely baseless pseudoscience. Owing to lack of significant scientific evidence, mistrust in the creators of the theory, general scepticism, or a combination of. However, there is some merit to be found - and assuming the previous tests are accurate, the following is how we hypothesize team RHAMJET would work together. <br>
          We have a nice mix of types, learning styles, and no overtly conflicting personalities. This variety means team RHAMJET has many perspectives to offer for every intricacy of our assignment.  <br>
          The group is primarily made up of introverts, with only two extroverts among us (Roma and Tyler). In theory this should lead to stagnant group meetings and difficulty communicating. However, in practice we’ve made great progress in meetings and communicate to an exceptional degree. <br>
          Much of the team is prospective (a 1 to 3 ratio, the same found in extroverts vs introverts). This could lead to an unstructured, unorganized workflow, but would also mean a high degree of flexibility in our planning. Regardless, our judging personalities should act as enough of an anchor to keep us on track regarding deadlines. <br>
          The variety of different learning styles and how we prefer to apply ourselves means we have many options in how we as team can approach a task. Each member will grasp different areas of a problem, and collaboration will only make us better.

            This job is about developing and training artificial intelligence using machine learning. The job is for ‘defense’ technologies for the Australian department of defense.

            In analyzing the group’s preferred jobs, the most common factor is software development and the programming languages that are in demand, such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, being highly coveted by companies. However, it is the type of software and the sectors that differ from all of us. Some of us will be working with the more corporate side of things, working on back-end development for large companies or start-ups. This would entail providing infrastructure for the company’s data management systems, creating mobile applications, setting up cloud services or ensuring that all their operating systems can run smoothly and efficiently. <br> <br>
            Our other members will be working on other areas of software development. Mobile gaming development is an ever-expanding field with a plethora of opportunities to choose from. We may contribute to the science industry, helping expand the biomedical field and help combat diseases or make scientific breakthroughs. Or we may help serve the country, tinker, and masterfully engineer more high-tech military systems, working in the R&D branch.  <br> <br>
            The career plans of our group are realistic and achievable with enough effort put in, as many of us want to find work in jobs that help serve users and people whether it be for science, defense, or general usage. Most of us intend to work in jobs that belong to the private sector, but there is an exception with Tyler, who plans to serve the public in the military as a systems engineer. </p>

          <h2 style="padding:3px">Industry Demand Report</h2>
          <p style="padding:5px">
            When it came to deciphering which team member’s ideal job title was the most in demand, based off the title itself independent of the industry, it was revealed by BurningGlass that Systems Engineers had been in the most demand, taking up 5.99% of the total job demand listed in Burning Glass. While there was no clear answer for the lowest demand job title, further research using the Australian Government’s Labour Market predictions revealed that Hunter held the lowest demand job due to its low potential growth in industry and lower median pay when compared to everyone else’s combined data. However, Roma’s job title of Cybersecurity Analyst was predicted to be the highest growth job title along with highest median pay, so in terms of future demand she may ultimately have the most in-demand job title. <br><br>
            The required skillsets generally match up with the most in-demand skills required, especially with the general skills that can be applicable to any career such as Communication skills which came up often, however the technical skills were surprisingly more varied than assumed, with skills like Scrum, Building Relationships and Business Analytics generally being more in demand than the required skillsets gathered from our ideal jobs. The three most in-demand skills not found in our required skillsets were:
