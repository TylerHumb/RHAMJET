Umm.
As you may know, this interview is part of our project for our assignment and we want to know about the daily life of an IT person.
So that is why we're interviewing you and asking you questions.
All right. I'm so before we start, I'll just use the team. So we got Tyler here.

Manoj Mathew1:01 pm
You know, I guess.
We are all good to start. Yeah. Should be OK.
Abel John1:01 pm
All good. All right. Tyler, moving. Take it away.
Tyler Humbert1:01 pm
Right. Oh, so thank you for coming today, Manoj. Let's just get straight into it. So do you want to tell us
about your IT work? What exactly do you do as an IT professional?
Mooneeta Bun1:01 pm
OK.
Manoj Mathew1:01 pm
OK. Yeah. So uh, before I start, you know my name is Manoj Mathew. I work as a senior project manager for Infosys and I've been
part of Infosys for the last 8.5 years as a senior project manager, I take bottom line responsibility for the projects that me
and my team deliver. I build the team when I say build the team, I build the IT project team consisting of developers, testers,
architects based business analysts and all of that comprises my.
Right Project team. I reviewed the software build progress on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.
Uh, you know, we also do ensure that you know, proper mitigation and risk and risk mitigation is in place for all the risks and
dependencies that's been called out. And one of the major responsibility as I've senior project manager for me is to ensure that
we successfully deliver and implement the project, you know, to customer satisfaction, right. And I take ownership for my team and
for that performance as well, so.
That's the high level.
No. What? What? It probably a capsule for format of what I do on a day to day basis.
Tyler Humbert1:03 pm
I don't thank you, Moon.
Mooneeta Bun1:03 pm
All right. Can you please tell us more about the company you work with like how might compared to another company or?
Manoj Mathew1:03 pm
OK, alright. So as I said, you know, I work for an organization called Infosys Limited. I'm not sure how many of you have heard
of Infosys, but just to give you context here, Infosys is one of the largest Indian multinational information technology company
that provides services in the field of business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. The company was founded.
From India or from a place called Pune and is headquartered currently in Bangalore, it is one of the second largest Indian IT company.
The no. The first been Tata Consultancy Services. I'm primarily talking this from a revenue figure standpoint by 2020 standards and
this is one of the I think in terms of numbers, it's a 609 second largest public company in the world, right? And you know it is one
of the fourth company that has crossed 100 billion in terms of market capitalization. So you can consider the amount. I mean it has about.
More than 600,000 people working across the globe across the different geographies, catering to multiple clients. The clientele can be
from automobile to pharma to telcos to various other industries.
And interestingly, this company was founded by 7 engineers in put back in back in 1981 with an initial capital of just $250. So.
And the the engineers whom probably people like you. You know when I mean they they found us were very excited. They came in from this one
team and with an initial seed capital of $250.
This started Infosys, which is now today 100 billion organization.
Tyler Humbert1:05 pm
Right. That's pretty impressive, eh?
Mooneeta Bun1:05 pm
Maybe we could do that little bit.
Manoj Mathew1:05 pm
Yeah.
Tyler Humbert1:05 pm
So what's your day to day job look like? Like what do you do on a daily?
You know.
Manoj Mathew1:05 pm
So yeah, yeah. So see my designation at Infosys is senior project manager, but on the ground, I play the role of a portfolio manager
or a program manager for my client, Optus and I have been playing the role of a portfolio manager or the program manager for Optus for
the last 2.5 years.
Where probably I'm responsible for multidimensional Infosys let programs.
Uh, you know where I'm also responsible for people on the project who are part of several teams.
Uh, I am. It is also my responsibility to identify new opportunities within Optus where probably we can have new revenue growth where
I need to anchor large proposals within Optus and manage the overall end to end it delivery for large portfolios. So I have a team of project
managers, architects, testers and developers, or putting into me. So I end of the day I'm responsible for the for this particular team
and the deliverables. Which is set for my account which is Optus.
Mooneeta Bun1:06 pm
OK.
And in the an average day as a program manager, who were you actually interacting with? And could you tell us about them?
As in a normal day.
Manoj Mathew1:06 pm
Yeah.
OK, so on a normal day, uh, let me put it under two key buckets. One is client side and one is Infosys side. You know on the client
side which is Optus inside work for Optus who which is one of the main telcos in Australia similar to your NBNS and Telstra of the
world. On the client side, I interact with some of the senior stakeholders and their designations can be product owners, product
managers, program delivery managers, business partners. Enterprise architects and so forth and on the Infosys side, you know, you
know we have and and we basically have an onshore offshore engagement model where the team consists of developers, testers, BAS,
Architects and all that. So it's a. It'll say multicultural team that we have, we have people from different geographies who work
together on a on a common cause of client engagement and yeah, so it's a it's a different set of people that we work and interact on a day to day basis.
Mooneeta Bun1:07 pm
So, like go international interest?
Manoj Mathew1:07 pm
Yep.
Mooneeta Bun1:07 pm
OK.
Tyler Humbert1:07 pm
Uh, could you tell us about some of your interactions with Optus and other investors?
Manoj Mathew1:08 pm
Yeah, to be honest, I don't have any interaction with any investors. But yes, with clients definitely it's a big guess.
I do have daily sync up with them as part of my daily scrum teams. So you know, I'm not sure if you're aware of.
Well, the stand up meetings that's happening, I I type organization. So we have a weekly daily 15 minute stand up where
everybody's supposed to say you know what has happened yesterday. What will you be doing today and if there are any impediments
or risk core issues. So basically every individual is given 2 minutes or three minutes at the Max to the basically brief about them.
Uh on the stand up, so there are occasions where client just walks into the daily stand up meeting of your of your team and they become
a partner. They become a party to the conversation. So yes, on a weekly basis, yes, I do have on a daily basis as I do have interactions
with client and that's in the form of stand up Scrum teams, scrum meetings and on the other side we also have governance meetings.
Where we need to call out where we need to present our status of the IT projects, where we need to call out if there are any red, amber
green rack status of the IT projects where we also need to call out any risks and issues and if they if we need any kind of support,
we need to bring it to clients notice. So we have these governance, we call it as gutthi governance meeting. So we have these governance
meetings scheduled weekly or fortnightly with probably some of the senior IT stakeholders.
So within the client teams, so those are my interactions with the clients on my weekly, daily and monthly basis.
Tyler Humbert1:10 pm
Radio.
Mooneeta Bun1:10 pm
Yeah.
You also use these meetings to manage like deadlines and commitments, or are there other measures you take with like everyone you manage?
Manoj Mathew1:10 pm
OK. That's a good question. In fact, most of the IT delivery, I'm not sure how many of you are exposed to.
So.
Uh agile ways of working or in these these days you call it as safe SA Fe. It's called scaled tile framework. It's something which has.
Ohh completely changed the way of the IT delivery. Used to work in the past. It was the traditional waterfall waterfall model. Now
what exactly happens is when you move to a scale agile framework delivery model you have.
For IT delivery, which has been delivered in smaller iterations or sprints, and each Sprint or an iteration is basically two week or a
10 day at the Max schedule that we have. And towards the end. And of and and it is in this particular two weeks, Sprint or iteration that
we do the entire IT delivery be design be it software build testing and all that. And towards the end we end up with a showcase or a demo
of what we want to deliver to the client and the client signs of this. So when you move to scale agile delivery model you know it's easier
to manage the deadlines and other commitments because. Uh, you know you you get to get, you get to hear the client feedback in smaller chunks,
which is within two weeks. You get to know instead of waiting for six months and end of end of six months, which was the traditional IT
delivery model, you get a negative feedback signal saying that, oh, this is not what I expected. Now when you move to a safe agile delivery
model, you get those feedbacks coming in from the client every now and then in every two weeks. So there is room for improvement.
If it's, if it is not aligned to the client vision. So as usual, there are these nice to haves and must to have solution requirement that
comes in from the client and we ensure that. Uh, you know these deadlines are met. The and commitments are met that the client has from a
business angle. the IT team, which is us, we also align to our customers business deadlines and commitments as well.
Mooneeta Bun1:12 pm
Alright, thank you for that.
Tyler Humbert1:12 pm
Umm.
Uh, so earlier you said that you had a bunch of people working under you. So how would you manage those people?
Manoj Mathew1:12 pm
Yeah. So basically you know.
See.
Yeah. So as I said, we have, uh.
A. Basically a huge number of team reporting it to me if I were to put a number. It's around 1:50 to 160 member team. Although
I don't manage them on a day to day basis because I have my next layer, the second layer or the third level. Who manages most of the teams
on the ground, but the way we usually manage my team or my subordinates is basically it's a transparent and honest engagement that we have.
It's never a carrot and stick approach. We empathize with the team. We understand the personal and professional aspirations.
The I mean we give them opportunities to unlearn and relearn, and we work in tandem with them. So you know, that's how we manage as a
team. End of the day. It's a team work. Ohh, but nobody in the team is a superstar in terms of. I mean, I can single handedly deliver
it because you know for my success I need deliverables from my. My team member, who probably needs to complete his or her testing for
me to successfully deploy it into production and all that so end of the day it delivery is all about teamwork and all our engagements
has been transparent and honest. Uh, and, and we empathize with the team and that's how we manage the whole engagement.
Mooneeta Bun1:14 pm
And I think that much is our experience on the ground level. Uh, we'll see in your day to day. What do you spend the most time doing?
Like, what do you end up doing for most of your time in your job?
Tyler Humbert1:14 pm
Friday.
Manoj Mathew1:14 pm
Yeah. So as I said, I play the role of a program manager for Optus, but on the ground since I have and each and since I manage a program,
these program consists of multiple IT projects and these IT projects have. The you know, dedicated project managers who runs, who runs these
project on a day to day basis. So me as a portfolio manager or a program manager, most of my time is spent on new proposals or in it term it's
called presales activity. So there are these RFP's and Rfis request for proposals and requests for intent which comes in from the client in
terms of new opportunities for Infosys to probably. Jump in and then convert it to new sales. So most of my time is spent on these presales
activity in terms of, you know, estimations sizing scoping of their requirements that has come from the client sizing in terms of fixed price
or a time and material costing resourcing and all that. So and then end of the day we might have to present this back to the.
The back to Optus or to climb, saying that this is the Infosys proposal. So we give a presentation back to them, we tell why you should be
basically signing up with us and all that. So most of my time these days are spent on new proposals and presales.
Mooneeta Bun1:16 pm
OK. Just.
Tyler Humbert1:16 pm
Right now, uh, which aspects of your job would you find the most challenging?
Manoj Mathew1:16 pm
Ohh of most challenging of I would say.
OK. So see the nature of business that we are in and you know it's an onshore offshore engagement that we have for for IT delivery.
So obviously we being in Australia, there's a time zone difference. The which is 4 and half hours or five and half half hour difference
based on you know the daylight savings and all that. So the work starts mostly for us at 8 AM, 8:30 AM and eight probably ends till 11:00 PM.
Not always. Not to give you guys a shock on that. But you know there are times where you need to sync up with your offshore team. And then
probably review the code or you know, you know, go through a trial, run a trial run. Ohh well prior to the showcases of the demos or anything
of that sort. So probably the offshore onshore engagement model because of the time zone difference. But that's something which we have got
accustomed to and that is something which we are which I'm finding as the most challenging one.
Mooneeta Bun1:17 pm
OK, that's something to consider. But on the other side, what do you find most satisfying about your job?
Tyler Humbert1:17 pm
Yeah, but.
Manoj Mathew1:17 pm
Yep, uh, good question again. See.
Uh.
Uh, he he. If you look at my career, we know and I've been with Infosys now for the last 8.5 years, right? That itself talks about how satisfied
I'm with work, you know? And that's predominantly not just the money factor, but Infosys as an organization has given ample opportunities for me
to unlearn and also relearn. And that is something which is very rare in an organization. Just to give you an example, I started as a business analyst.
In Infosys, you know went up the value chain as a solution designer end to end designer project manager.
Ohm portfolio manager at delivery manager and all that, right, so you know and and this.
Kind of a window.
So of opportunity in terms of your career progression and all that was given and that is something which is which makes me satisfied in my current work at Infosys.
Tyler Humbert1:18 pm
Uh, so finally last question, can you show an example of your work that best captures the essence of the IT industry?
Manoj Mathew1:18 pm
Could you repeat that?
Tyler Humbert1:18 pm
Uh, could you share an example of your work that best captures the essence of the IT industry?
Manoj Mathew1:19 pm
OK.
OK, let me give you an example of I'm sure most of you are in some form and shape. Customers of Optus or Telstra or NBNS of the world.
Uh, you know, I mean, let me talk from an Optus angle.
Uh, you might buy in a handset.
Or a prepaid or postpaid service. You know, all that you do is walk into an Optus shop or at any of the malls or any of the other.
Well, that woman for places nearby. Or you might log into the Optus website now.
That becomes your first IT touch point right now behind the scene. I mean obviously when you walk in there, you might need, let's say,
Abel needs a prepaid or postpaid service. And the first question that the service desk person might ask is, I mean, do you have, uh,
let me do some ID checks for you, right. So they do a credit check. Come on. So they basically the first thing that they do is they
create a customer ID for table and I mean. And behind the scene, uh, you know the portal. The Optus portal is integrated with a CRM
system, customer relationship management system, which is built on Amdocs Jarvis system where the customer, a unique customer ID is
being generated first for able based on his date of birth and mobile number and all that. So that becomes his customer ID and once the
customer ID is generated what happens is. Uh, you know, the next question is OK, could you please share your passport or any other identification documents?
UH bank documents and all that. So there's a credit check that's been done for Abel. And for that there are so.
If for, for a, for a customer like cable, he only sees the portal in place behind the scene. You know you have certain third party.
Ohh government or government applications called Equifax and all that which does credit work. Check for Abel now if if it's all green
you know basically the CRM system gives me a response back saying yes, I'm all good credit check has come out clean for Abel. Let's place
it in order for Abel. Now what happens is Abel will now once these two steps are completed you have something called as.
Order fulfillment or the lead to cache journey. You know basically what happens is you know.
So you, you know, basically, you know, Abel might say, I've come here for a postpaid service and alongside this I need a handset. And
alongside that I need probably a home broadband at my home as well. Right. So this becomes a quote in telco terms. It becomes a code
and that becomes we basically. You know what, keen? All the necessities of able to its system called CPQ customer price quote which
basically generates a quote back to able saying that yes you have ordered a postpaid service you have ordered a handset and you have also
ordered for a home broadband at your home right so that and that's and that's been generated through the portal again as a PDF document.
And and we leave it with Abel for his review of his coat. Now, once Abel says yes, I'm all happy with the code and all that. You know,
the fulfillment of its starts, the payment mechanisms have been set up in terms of credit cards or whatever. And that happens and it's
and the customer journey ends up not just on the lead to cache journey, which is order fulfillment payments and that's it.
There's also something called as trouble to resolve, which is basically, you know, let's say tomorrow there is a issue at this home broadband.
How does he raise a ticket? It has to be a ticket through service now and all that. So I mean, you do proactive.
Well, more repair of the complaints of Abel's home home broadband. So all those things also happen. So I'm just giving you a simple
example where it captures the essence of an IT industry. You know, a simple request for a post, paid service or a prepaid service.
So these are the multiple touch points that you do for able as a customer. It is only one single UI or a portal that he touched bases. But behind the scene you have.
STEM system, a fulfillment system. A payment system.
And finally, maybe even we might call in for a site engineer to visit his home to check whether his router and Wi-Fi is working or not.
So all of this works has to work in synergy and in tandem, and that's how. That's where me and my team works behind the scenes to ensure that enable as a customer.
Well, it's happy with the postpaid and prepaid service that he has ordered with Optus. So it's that, that's I hope that's a simple example
of how we work and that captures the essence of the IT industry.
Mooneeta Bun1:24 pm
Yeah, it's it's very informative, yeah.
Tyler Humbert1:24 pm
Yeah, I was a really good one.
Manoj Mathew1:24 pm
Yep.
Tyler Humbert1:24 pm
So that brings us to the conclusion of the interview. Sorry, do you have any final questions?
Manoj Mathew1:24 pm
So that's it for me.
Ohh, I wish this team the very best as as part of your studies. I understand that this interview is done as part of your studies,
so all the best to you and do well and hope to see you in the corporate world soon.
Tyler Humbert1:25 pm
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to do this interview for us. You gave us some really good answers. So thanks for that. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Manoj Mathew1:25 pm
Thank you.
And same to you. Thank you.
Tyler Humbert1:25 pm
That stop the recording.
Mooneeta Bun1:25 pm
Thank you. Bye.

            <h3>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
            <p>From this question we understood that the responsibilities of a senior project manager are to manage all the projects of the team they are with.
              A team comprises of developers, software architects, business analytics, testers, etc.  They are also responsible to manage the progress done by all
              the workers under them; any risks found within the work must be resolved as well. To ensure the work is going as planned, he reviews the project on
              a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The final outcome of the position is to make sure that his team delivers the product to the customer on time with
              customer satisfaction.  As expected of the position of a manager, there are a lot of responsibilities to manage the other team members. However,
              he mentions that he ‘takes ownership’ of the team, it’s interesting as not only does he need to manage his team, but he’ll be also the one responsible
              for the team’s final outcome.   </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="Analy">
            <h3>Please tell us about the company you work in.</h3>
            <p>Manoj works for Infosys as mentioned in his introduction. From his brief overview of the history of the company to its current position, it is clear
              to say that Infosys is a large Indian company with a range of workers from across the globe.  </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="Analy">
            <h3>What is your day-to-day job like? </h3>
            <p>Though his role at Infosys is a senior project manager, his day-to-day job is a program manager for his client Optus. While having the responsibility
              of managing his team at Optus, he is also responsible to find ‘new opportunities’ for the growth of Optus.  </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="Analy">
            <h3>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. </h3>
            <p>Since Manoj is working for Optus through Infosys, he has to interact with both of the companies. For the Optus side he has to deal with people such as
              ‘product owners, product managers, program delivery managers, business partners,’ etc. For the offshore side or the Infosys side, he has to interact with
              the ‘enterprise architects.’	 Overall, on a daily basis Manoj interacts with a range of people in a ‘multicultural’ team from different geographies. </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="Analy">
            <h3>Tell us about your interactions with clients or investors, if any? </h3>
            <p>On a daily basis Manoj attends his stand-up meetings where every member must update to the rest of the group about what happened yesterday. Each member will
              speak for 2-3 minutes. During the standup members need to say the status of their work, these can be red, amber or green. Members also need to bring up any
              risks or issues in their work. There are occasions where clients would walk into a standup meeting, so in a weekly basis there will be client interactions </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="Analy">
            <h3>How do you manage deadlines and other commitments?  </h3>
            <p>A modern-day IT methodology is the agile methodology. As Manoj mentions this methodology is much safer and easier to organize in comparison to the traditional
              linear waterfall methodology.  In the agile methodology there are small deliverables in sprints within 2 weeks. The benefit of this is that clients can provide
              small feedback every 2 weeks rather than at the end of the development cycle in the waterfall methodology. Agile also allows the flexibility to go back and fix any errors or changes mentioned by the client.  </p>

            <h3>How do you manage with your subordinates, if any?  </h3>
            <p>Since there is a large group of people to manage, around 150 – 160 people, there are layers of managers to control them and so he does not manage all of
              them daily. He manages his team my being ‘transparent and honest,’ rather than forcing or leading his workers. Instead of one person doing the job, it’s
              teamwork at the end of the day.  </p>

            <h3>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
            <p>Since Manoj plays the role of a portfolio manager/ program manager for Infosys at Optus, Manoj's role is to manage all the ongoing Infosys projects at Optus. He is also
              responsible to find new work and opportunities for Infosys within Optus. Most of his time is spent on presales activities such as responding to the RFPs (request for
              proposal) and RFIs (request for information), which includes estimation (broad overview of the project as a whole), sizing (finding the size of the project, taking in
              consideration of the number of workers as well as time available) and scope (Constraints, considerations, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, what the
              final product will and will not do). He is also a point of any escalations for the ongoing projects. </p>

            <h3>What part of your work do you find the most challenging </h3>
            <p>Due to Manoj working as a project manager for a business as large as Optus Manoj has to communicate with fellow Infosys employees from all over the world in “offshore
              engagement”. Due to living in Australia he gets the short end of the stick and usually has to work until from 8am till 11pm in order to sync up with his offshore team.
              He states that “it’s something which we have got accustomed to and that is something which I'm finding as the most challenging one.” (from transcript very rough) </p>

            <h3>what do you find most satisfying about your job? </h3>
            <p>Manoj finds the most satisfying part of his work the opportunity to learn and unlearn skills and the ability to progress through his career, something that Manoj states
              is very rare in an organisation. Manoj originally started his career at Infosys as a business analysist and thanks to the opportunities offered by Infosys he was able to
              progress up the corporate ladder into a project manager and it is these opportunities that Manoj finds most satisfying about his work. </p>

            <h3>Can you share an example of your work that best captures the essence of the IT industry </h3>
            <p>For this question Manoj decided to give us an example of the scope of the IT industry and how so much of it goes unnoticed by people in their day-to-day life. To demonstrate
              this he explained everything behind the process of signing up for a prepaid sim card with Optus, takings us through every step of the process one by one, starting with creating
              a customer ID which is inputted into the Optus portal which is a customer relationship management system, how 3rd party government applications then preform a credit check on the
              customer to ensure the payment can be made, then only after that is done the order is sent through and processed, the order is then processed into a quote to confirm that the
              order was placed. This is just one example, but it shows just how much IT work is behind something as simple as a transaction to sign someone up for a prepaid sim card </p>
